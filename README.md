# desktopclock-qt

## A Simple, small desktop clock app built with QML and Python.

To try to learn making an app from scratch, I have decided to make a simple desktop app with Python, using experience I already have with QML. As a result, I have made this clock app, which functions nicely to fill screen space.

### General Use and Configuration

To launch this app, download this repo and run the python script. The clock, date and background should be automatically set.

In the menu button on the top right, you can change several options. You can change whether the clock is in 24-hour format, change whether the background image is blurred, and change the background image. By default, the clock is in 12-hour format, the background image is blurred, and the background image is the image backgrounds/default.png.

You can change the default background by changing the file that is backgrounds/default.png. For the other modifications, go into home.qml and modify the corresponding values.

### To-do

- Change file picker to something more visually appealing and usable
- Figure out if you can click a button through a QML MouseArea
- More Customizations?
